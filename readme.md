## WALLFLOWER ENGINE LITE

Wallflower Engine Lite is a 2D small scale version of Wallflower Engine made in Python.

Specifically made with rapid prototyping in mind, this python version of Wallflower is made with game jams
and small projects in mind.

It uses a Python port of Dear ImGui for all engine GUI.

this was abandoned, but if anyone wants to work on it feel free.
